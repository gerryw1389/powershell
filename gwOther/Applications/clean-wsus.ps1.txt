#         Prerequisites        #
################################

1. This script has to be saved as plain text in ANSI format. If you use Notepad++, you might need to
   change the encoding to ANSI (Encoding > 'Encode in ANSI' or Encode > 'Convert to ANSI').
   An easy way to tell if it is saved in plain text (ANSI) format is that there is a #Requires
   statement at the top of the script. Make sure that there is a hyphen before the word
   "Version" and you shouldn't have a problem with executing it. If you end up with an error
   like below, it is due to the encoding of the file as you can tell by the â€“ characters
   before the word Version.

   At C:\Scripts\Clean-WSUS.ps1:1 char:13
   + #Requires â€“Version 3.0

2. You must run this on the WSUS Server itself and any downstream WSUS servers you may have.
   It does not matter the order on where you run it as the script takes care of everything
   for you.

3. On the WSUS Server, you must install the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) from Microsoft
   so that you have the SQLCMD utility. The SSMS is not a requirement but rather a good tool for
   troubleshooting if needed. The bare minimum requirement is the Microsoft Command Line
   Utilities for SQL Server at whatever version yours is.

4. You must have PowerShell 3.0 or higher installed. I recommend version 4.0 or higher.

    A note to SBS users:
        For those of you who have already Googled and have read that there are compatibility issues with PowerShell 3.0
        or 4.0 and/or Windows Management Framework 3.0 or 4.0 and have seen all of the release notes and posts saying
        not to install these on SBS, please take notes of the dates of these pages and advice notes. Most of these are
        relying on and regurgitating old information. If a site has a recent post that says not to install it as there
        are compatibility issues, find their source of information and if you follow the source, you'll notice that
        they are regurgitating a post from years ago. When you are reading things on the Internet, think critically,
        look at dates, and use your intelligence to figure out if it still makes sense. Don't blindly rely on words
        on pages of the internet.

        An example is .NET 4.7 which was released 2017.06.15 and which has a warning to not install .NET 4.7 on an
        Exchange server. This holds true until it can be properly tested, and if issues found, patches to .NET 4.7.x
        released for compatibility with Exchange. The biggest issue - all previous forums, blogs and writings on the
        Internet will not be updated to say that .NET 4.7 is now compatible to install on Exchange servers. This
        showcases my point that imagine in 2019 someone who is thinking about updating an Exchange server, Googling
        to find out if .NET 4.7 is compatible (when current version of .NET is probably around version 5.0 or 5.1)
        and finding all these warnings about not installing it on an Exchange server.

        One note for any system, but something to mention specifically for this thought:
        The best thing you can do is make sure your system is updated. Non-updated systems suffer problems and exploits
        that in the end, cause you more time in troubleshooting and fixing than to keep systems updated.

################################
#         Instructions         #
################################

 1. Edit the variables below to match your environment (It's only email server settings if you
    use my default settings)
 2. Open PowerShell using "Run As Administrator" on the WSUS Server.
 3. Because you downloaded this script from the internet, you cannot initially run it directly
    as the ExecutionPolicy is default set to "Restricted" (Server 2008, Server 2008 R2, and
    Server 2012) or "RemoteSigned" (Server 2012 R2).  You must change your ExecutionPolicy to
    Bypass. You can do this with Set-ExecutionPolicy, however that will change it globally for
    the server, which is not recommended. Instead, launch another PowerShell.exe with the
    ExecutionPolicy set to bypass for just that session. At your current PowerShell prompt,
    type in the following and then press enter:

        PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

 3. Run the script using -FirstRun.

        .\Clean-WSUS.ps1 -FirstRun

You can use Get-Help .\Clean-WSUS.ps1 for more information.

.DESCRIPTION
################################
#    Background Information    #
#          on Streams          #
################################

All my recommendations are set in -ScheduledRun.

Adamj WSUS Index Optimization Stream
-----------------------------------------------------

This stream will add the necessary SQL Indexes into the SUSDB Database that make WSUS work about
1,000 to 1,500 times faster on many database operations, making your WSUS installation better
than what Microsoft has left us with.

This stream will be run first on -FirstRun to ensure the rest of the script doesn't take as long
as it has in prior times.

You can use -WSUSIndexOptimization to run this manually from the command-line.

Adamj Remove WSUS Drivers Stream
-----------------------------------------------------

This stream will remove all WSUS Drivers Classifications from the WSUS database.
This has 2 possible running methods - Run through PowerShell, or Run directly in SQL.
The -FirstRun Switch will force the SQL method, but all other automatic runs will use the
PowerShell method. I recommend this be done every quarter.

You can use -RemoveWSUSDriversSQL or -RemoveWSUSDriversPS to run these manually from the command-line.

Adamj Remove Obsolete Updates Stream
-----------------------------------------------------

This stream will use SQL code to execute pre-existing stored procedures that will return the update id
of each obsolete update in the database and then remove it. There is no magic number of obsolete updates
that will cause the server to time-out. Running this stream can easily take a couple of hours to delete
the updates. While the process is running you might see WSUS synchronization errors. I recommend that
this be done monthly.

You can use -RemoveObsoleteUpdates to run this manually from the command-line.

Adamj Compress Update Revisions Stream
-----------------------------------------------------

This stream will use SQL code to execute pre-existing stored procedures that will return the update id
of each update revision that needs compressing and then compress it. I recommend that this be done
monthly.

You can use -CompressUpdateRevisions to run this manually from the command-line.

Adamj Decline Multiple Types Of Updates Stream
-----------------------------------------------------

This stream will decline multiple types of updates: Superseded, Expired, and Itanium to name a few.
This is configurable on a per-type basis for inclusion or exclusion when the stream is run.

I recommend that this stream be run every month.

You can use -DeclineMultipleTypesOfUpdates to run this manually from the command-line.

### A note about the default types of updates to be removed. ###

Expired: Decline updates that have been pulled by Microsoft.
Itanium: Decline updates for Itanium computers.
Beta: Decline updates for beta products and beta updates.
Superseded: Decline updates that are superseded and not yet declined.
Preview: Decline preview updates as preview updates may contain bugs because they are not the finished product.

### Please read the background information below on superseded updates for more details. ###

This will be the biggest factor in shrinking down the size of your WSUS Server. Any update that
has been superseded but has not been declined is using extra space. This will save you GB of data
in your WsusContent folder. A superseded update is a complete replacement of a previous release
update. The superseding update has everything that the superseded update has, but also includes
new data that either fixes bugs, or includes something more.

The Server Cleanup Wizard (SCW) declines superseded updates, only if:

    The newest update is approved, and
    The superseded updates are Not Approved, and
    The superseded update has not been reported as NotInstalled (i.e. Needed) by any computer in the previous 30 days.

There is no feature in the product to automatically decline superseded updates on approval of the newer update,
and in fact, you really do not want that feature. The "Best Practice" in dealing with this situation is:

1. Approve the newer update.
2. Verify that all systems have installed the newer update.
3. Verify that all systems now report the superseded update as Not Applicable.
4. THEN it is safe to decline the superseded update.

To SEARCH for superseded updates, you need only enable the Superseded flag column in the All Updates view, and sort on that column.

There will be four groups:

1. Updates which have never been superseded (blank icon).
2. Updates which have been superseded, but have never superseded another update (icon with blue square at bottom).
3. Updates which have been superseded and have superseded another update (icon with blue square in middle).
4. Updates which have superseded another update (icon with blue square at top).

There's no way to filter based on the approval status of the updates in group #4, but if you've verified that all
necessary/applicable updates in group #4 are approved and installed, then you'd be free to decline groups #2 and #3 en masse.

If you decline superseded updates using the method described:

1. Approve the newer update.
2. Verify that all systems have installed the newer update.
3. Verify that all systems now report the superseded update as Not Applicable.
4. THEN it is safe to decline the superseded update.

### THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT FOLLOW THE ABOVE GUIDELINES. IT WILL JUST DECLINE ANY SUPERSEDED UPDATES. ###

Adamj Clean Up WSUS Synchronization Logs Stream
-----------------------------------------------------

This stream will remove all synchronization logs beyond a specified time period. WSUS is lacking the ability
to remove synchronization logs through the GUI. Your WSUS server will become slower and slower loading up
the synchronization logs view as the synchronization logs will just keep piling up over time. If you have
your synchronization settings set to synchronize 4 times a day, it would take less than 3 months before you
have over 300 logs that it has to load for the view. This is very time consuming and many just ignore this
view and rarely go to it. When they accidentally click on it, they curse. I recommend that this be done daily.

You can use -CleanUpWSUSSynchronizationLogs to run this manually from the command-line.

Adamj Remove Declined WSUS Updates Stream
-----------------------------------------------------

This stream will remove any Declined WSUS updates from the WSUS Database. This is good if you are removing
Specific products (Like Server 2003 / Windows XP updates) from the WSUS server under the Products and
Classifications section. Since this will remove them from the database, if they are still valid, and you
want them to re-appear, you will have to re-add them using 1 of 2 methods. Use the 'Import Update' option
from within the WSUS Console to install specific updates through the Windows Catalog, or remove the product
family, sync, re-select the product family, and then the next synchronizations will pick up the updates
again, along with everything else in that product family. I recommend that this be done every quarter.
This stream is NOT included on -FirstRun on purpose.

You can use -RemoveDeclinedWSUSUpdates to run this manually from the command-line.

Adamj Computer Object Cleanup Stream
-----------------------------------------------------

This stream will find all computers that have not synchronized with the server within a certain time period
and remove them. This is usually done through the Server Cleanup Wizard (SCW), however the SCW has been
hard-coded to 30 days. I've setup this stream to be configurable. You can also tell it not to delete any
computer objects if you really want to. The default I've kept at 30 days. I recommend that this be done daily.

You can use -ComputerObjectCleanup to run this manually from the command-line.

Adamj WSUS Database Maintenance Stream
-----------------------------------------------------

This stream will perform basic maintenance tasks on SUSDB, the WSUS Database. It will identify indexes
that are fragmented and defragment them. For certain tables, a fill-factor is set in order to improve
insert performance. It will then update potentially out-of-date table statistics. I recommend that this
be done daily.

You can use -WSUSDBMaintenance to run this manually from the command-line.

Adamj Server Cleanup Wizard Stream
-----------------------------------------------------

The Server Cleanup Wizard (SCW) is integrated into the WSUS GUI, and can be used to help you manage your
disk space. This runs the SCW through PowerShell which has the added bonus of not timing out as often
the SCW GUI would.

This wizard can do the following things:
    - Remove unused updates and update revisions
      The wizard will remove all older updates and update revisions that have not been approved.

    - Delete computers not contacting the server
      The wizard will delete all client computers that have not contacted the server in thirty days or more.
      This is DISABLED by default as the Computer Object Cleanup Stream takes care of this in a more
      configurable method.

    - Delete unneeded update files
      The wizard will delete all update files that are not needed by updates or by downstream servers.

    - Decline expired updates
      The wizard will decline all updates that have been expired by Microsoft.

    - Decline superseded updates
      The wizard will decline all updates that meet all the following criteria:
          The superseded update is not mandatory
          The superseded update has been on the server for thirty days or more
          The superseded update is not currently reported as needed by any client
          The superseded update has not been explicitly deployed to a computer group for ninety days or more
          The superseding update must be approved for install to a computer group

I recommend that this be done daily. When using -FirstRun, all of the script's streams perform compression and
removal tasks prior to the SCW being run. Therefore, with the exception of DiskSpaceFreed, all of the other
fields of the SCW will return 0 when using -FirstRun.

You can use -WSUSServerCleanupWizard to run this manually from the command-line.

Adamj Application Pool Memory Configuration Stream
-----------------------------------------------------
Why does the WSUS Application pool crash and how can we fix it? The WSUS Application pool has a
"private memory limit" setting that is configured by default to a low number based on RAM. The
Application pool crashes because it can't keep up and the limit is reached. So why couldn't the WSUS
Application pool keep up? This has to do with the larger number of updates in the Update Catalog
(database) which continues to grow over time. WSUS does not handle an excessive number of updates well
and as as the number increases, the load on the application pool increases causing it to slowly run out
of memory until the limit is hit and WSUS crashes. I've seen it start having issues above the low
number of 10,000 updates and above the high number of 100,000 updates. The number of updates can in
part be due to obsolete updates that remain in the database and it varies in every system and
implementation. In order to help alleviate this, we can increase the memory on the WSUS Application Pool.

I recommend that this be done manually, only if necessary, by the command-line.

-DisplayApplicationPoolMemory to display the current application pool memory.
-SetApplicationPoolMemory <number in MB> to set the private memory limit by the number specified.

Adamj Dirty Database Check Stream
-----------------------------------------------------

From a similar phrase from the movie 'Sleeping With Other People', I coined this stream the
Dirty Database Check. This stream will run a SQL Query that originally came from Microsoft but has been
expanded by me to include all future upgrades of Windows 10. This SQL query checks to see if your
database is 'in a bad state' which is Microsoft's wording but mine sounds a whole lot more fun :)

In addition to checking to see if you have a dirty database, it will fully fix your database
automatically if it is found to be dirty. This again follows Microsoft's methods, but expanded
by me to include all future upgrades of Windows 10.

If your upgrades for Windows 10 are not installing properly and have been approved on your WSUS
server, run this check to see if you have a dirty database and subsequently fix it.

I recommend that this be done manually from the command-line, if you suspect that you may have a
dirty database.

You can use -DirtyDatabaseCheck to run this manually from the command-line.

    <#
This script is meant to be run daily. It is not just an ad-hock WSUS cleaning tool but rather
it's a daily maintenance tool. -FirstRun does NOT run all the routines on purpose, and uses certain
switches that SHOULD NOT be used consistently. If you choose to ignore this and switch the
$AdamjInstallScheduledTask variable to $False, please know that you can encounter problems with
WSUS in the future that you can't explain. One should not blame Microsoft for messing up WSUS or not
being able to make a product that works (like so many others have done), but rather blame themselves
for not running the appropriate WSUS Maintenance routines (declining superseded updates, running the
WSUS maintenance SQL script, running the server cleanup wizard, etc), to keep WSUS running smoothly.

For those enterprise environments or environments where you want more control over when this script
runs its streams, I've included the different switches (DailyRun, MonthlyRun, and QuarterlyRun) to be
used on the appropriate schedules. Do not mistake these options as assuming this script should be run
only when you feel it is necessary. For these environments, please set the $AdamjInstallScheduledTask
variable to $False and then manually create at least 3 scheduled tasks to run the -DailyRun,
-MonthlyRun, and -QuarterlyRun switches following the template of -InstallTask's schedule.

The bad news is that WSUS database has over 100 tables. The good news is that SQL allows to enforce referential
integrity in data model designs, which in this case can be used to essentially reverse engineer a procedure,
that as far as I know isn't documented anywhere.

The trick is to delete all driver type records from tbUpdate table - but FIRST we have to delete all records in
all other tables (revisions, languages, dependencies, files, reports...), which refer to driver rows in tbUpdate.

Here's how this is done, in 16 tables/queries.
